🔐 Strong Password Generator – Theoretical Overview
A Strong Password Generator is a tool that automatically creates secure, unpredictable passwords. These passwords help protect user accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access by making them difficult to guess or crack.

🎯 Purpose of the Program
The goal is to generate a password based on the user’s preferences, including:

Desired password length

Whether to include:

Digits (e.g., 0-9)

Special characters (e.g., !@#$%)

Uppercase letters (e.g., A-Z)

Lowercase letters (e.g., a-z)

🧠 Core Concepts Used
1. Character Sets
A character set is a group of characters from which the password will be generated.

Users can choose one or more sets:

Digits: Numbers for added complexity.

Special characters: Symbols that enhance password strength.

Uppercase letters: Increases difficulty for brute force attacks.

Lowercase letters: Commonly used but necessary for diversity.

2. Random Selection
A random process selects characters from the chosen sets.

Each character in the password is picked independently to ensure unpredictability.

3. User Input
The program asks the user for preferences like:

How long the password should be

What types of characters to include

The password is then built using these preferences.

4. Validation
If the user does not select any character set, the program alerts the user with an error message.

This prevents the creation of an empty or invalid password.

5. Password Output
After generation, the password is displayed to the user.

It’s designed to be ready for use in login forms or account creation.

✅ Benefits of This Approach
Secure: Avoids patterns and uses random logic.

Customizable: Allows users to decide what kind of password they need.

Efficient: Instantly generates a strong password based on rules.

User-friendly: Can be used even by non-technical users.

📌 Summary
The program uses random selection from user-defined character sets to generate a password of specified length. It ensures password strength and gives control to the user while maintaining simplicity and security.
